Behavior is composed of modules that operate based on inherent logic. Understanding behavior and its neural mechanisms is facilitated by clear structural behavioral analysis. Here, we developed a hierarchical behavioral analysis framework (HBAF) that efficiently reveals the organizational logic of these modules by analyzing complex behavioral data through dimensionality reduction.
